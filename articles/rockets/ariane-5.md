**Ariane 5** is a heavy-lift rocket designed and manufactured by the *European Space Agency (ESA)* and its industrial partners. It is one of the world's most powerful rockets and is used primarily to launch large commercial satellites and scientific payloads into orbit around the Earth.

The **Ariane 5** rocket is 52 meters tall and has a diameter of 5.4 meters. It consists of two solid rocket boosters and a core stage powered by a cryogenic rocket engine that burns liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 10 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or up to 20 metric tons to low Earth orbit (LEO).

One of the key features of the **Ariane 5** is its versatility. It can be configured with different types of fairings, or protective covers, to accommodate payloads of various sizes and shapes. The rocket can also be equipped with a third stage called the Sylda, which allows it to carry multiple payloads on a single launch.

The **Ariane 5** has a strong track record of reliability and safety, with over 100 successful launches since its debut in 1996. However, it has faced some technical challenges over the years, including a number of launch failures that led to the loss of valuable payloads.

In recent years, the ESA has been developing a new rocket called the Ariane-6, which is designed to be more cost-effective and adaptable to a wider range of payloads. The **Ariane-6** is expected to make its first flight in 2022 and will eventually replace the **Ariane 5** as the ESA's primary heavy-lift rocket.
